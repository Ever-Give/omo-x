Hey everyone, here is the first chapter of my first attempt at fanfiction 😄

An Unforgettable Night

Saturday night, 9:45 PM

The sky over the city was dark and heavy, like a storm was about to hit. Outside the movie theater, fancy cars lined up under flickering neon lights, lighting up people coming and going. Inside one theater, a romantic thriller was reaching its final moments.

In the middle row, seats C12 and C13, sat a woman who clearly wasn’t into the movie.

Clara, 27, was rocking tight blue jeans that hugged her curves. A classy white blouse and nude heels made her look ready for a fun Saturday night date. Her long wavy hair was tied low, showing off her graceful neck. Her makeup was light, but she still caught eyes without even trying.

Next to her was Edward, her boyfriend of almost two years. He looked cool, wearing an expensive watch and oozing confidence.

But tonight, Clara was really uncomfortable. Not because of the movie or the theater, but because she’d been holding in her pee since getting stuck in traffic. Edward knew it too, but kept delaying letting her go.

“Ed… I really gotta pee,” Clara whispered, leaning toward him.

Edward gave a little annoying smirk in the dark and said, “Hold on, babe. The movie’s almost over. Can’t you wait a bit longer?”

Clara frowned. “I’m serious, it’s getting bad.”

Edward reached for her hand and stroked it gently. “Relax. You’re kinda cute when you’re worried. Adorable.”

Annoyed, Clara pulled her hand away. Sweat started to bead at her temples even though the AC was on. She squeezed her thighs and shifted uncomfortably. The pressure in her lower belly was unbearable. She glanced around, everyone was glued to the screen. Edward didn’t budge.

“Ed, if you don’t let me go, I—”

“I’m sure you can hold it till the movie end,” he challenged.

Clara stared daggers at him.

And then, right at that moment…

A loud explosion in the movie perfectly marked what happened next.

She held her breath.

Her body tensed.

And…

It was too late.

A quiet hiss.

Warmth spreading.

A faint pee smell sneaking out.

Her tight jeans couldn’t hold back the flood she’d been fighting. Clara froze, shocked. Tears welled up—not just from embarrassment, but pure anger. Deep, burning anger.

The pee spread fast, darkening fabric on her thighs, legs, and butt. Edward, who’d been smirking all along, suddenly realized what’d happened.

“Clara… you actually peed yourself?”

“YES! BECAUSE OF YOU!” Clara snapped.

She stood up, her jeans soaked and stains clearly visible even in the dim light. People turned, whispering. A woman covered her mouth in shock. But Clara didn’t care anymore.

Was she embarrassed? Of course. But more than that, she was hurt.

“Edward… you know I gotta go. But you treated it like a joke. I’m not a doll for you to mess with,” she said, voice trembling with held-back tears.

Edward stood and grabbed her shoulder. “Clara, I thought you wouldn’t really pee yourself. I thought you could hold it.”

Clara took a step back, tears falling.

Some people started to stand. A staff member came over, probably hearing the commotion. Clara quickly walked out, her heels clicking on the wooden floor.

Women’s Bathroom – 10:20 PM

Clara stood in front of the mirror, running water loudly to drown out her crying. She rinsed her jeans, trying to clean them as best as she could. But nothing could wash away the shame and anger she felt. Not just because she’d peed herself, but because none of this would’ve happened if Edward hadn’t been such a jerk.

Her phone buzzed. Edward’s name kept popping up. She ignored it.

Lobby – 10:35 PM

Clara tried hard to hide the wet stain on her jeans while ordering a Uber. When Edward showed up again, she just said,

“I need some time. Don’t call me right now.”
