Years ago when I was younger a read a great story, and now I want to read it again.... problem is I cant find it :/

The story was about a group of friends having a sleepover. They were sleeping in the basement and couldn't/didn't want to go up stairs to the bathroom as they didn't want to wake their parents. They though if they went to the bathroom they would wake them and not be allowed to go to the mall the day after. So basically they spent the whole night desperate in the basement.

I'd really love to find this story again, so can anyone help please :)
