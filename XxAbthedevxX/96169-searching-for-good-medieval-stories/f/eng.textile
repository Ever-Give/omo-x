I once wrote a story which was written as though it could have been one of the stories collected by the Brother’s Grimm. Which I think qualifies it as a medieval story but in a kind of roundabout meta way.

I feel a bit weird linking one of my own stories in a thread about “good” stories but it fits what you’re looking for and you may not have read it. You be the judge if it’s good or not, I suppose.

Hmm in that case… I gotta say, I’m drawing a bit of a blank. The “big ones” in this genre have been linked and I can’t think of too many obscure examples. Are you looking for something with no fantastical elements or is a story with magic and whatnot acceptable?

Definitely would love magic and fantasy elements, I am looking specifically for nobility tropes where people have to hold it due to social reasons or they find innovative ways to tend to their needs.

Some of the stories by @GadgetCereal

Then, perhaps? Though those aren't too obscure either.
